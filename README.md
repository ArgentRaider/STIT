# STIT - Stitch it in Time

For details of the original README, see [link](https://github.com/rotemtzaban/STIT/blob/main/README.md) .

## Data requirements

A video should be splitted into individual frame images and put in a single directory, as mentioned in [link](https://github.com/rotemtzaban/STIT#splitting-videos-into-frames) .
It's advised to put frame images in 'data/{name}/', where '{name}' would be used to store the checkpoint after PTI tuning through scripts. For example: data/someone/00001.jpeg.
